/**
 * In computer science, radix sort is a non-comparative sorting algorithm. It avoids
 * comparison by creating and distributing elements into buckets according to their radix. For
 * elements with more than one significant digit, this bucketing process is repeated for each
 * digit, while preserving the ordering of the prior step, until all digits have been considered.
 * For this reason, radix sort has also been called bucket sort and digital sort.
 *
 * Radix sort can be applied to data that can be sorted lexicographically, be they integers, words,
 * punch cards, playing cards, or the mail.
