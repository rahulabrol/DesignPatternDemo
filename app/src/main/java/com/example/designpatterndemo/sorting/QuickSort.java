/**
 * QuickSort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element as pivot
 * and partitions the given array around the picked pivot. There are many different
 * versions of quickSort that pick pivot in different ways.
 * <p>
 * Always pick first element as pivot.
 * Always pick last element as pivot (implemented below)
 * Pick a random element as pivot.
 * Pick median as pivot.
 * The key process in quickSort is partition(). Target of partitions is, given an array
 * and an element x of array as pivot, put x at its correct position in sorted array and put
 * all smaller elements (smaller than x) before x, and put all greater elements (greater than x) after x.
 * All this should be done in linear time.
 * <p>
 * [Analysis of QuickSort]
 * Time taken by QuickSort in general can be written as following.
 * <p>
 * T(n) = T(k) + T(n-k-1) + \theta(n)
 * The first two terms are for two recursive calls, the last term is for the partition
 * process. k is the number of elements which are smaller than pivot.
 * The time taken by QuickSort depends upon the input array and partition strategy. Following are three cases.
 *
 * @{1.} Worst Case: The worst case occurs when the partition process always picks greatest
 * or smallest element as pivot. If we consider above partition strategy where last
 * element is always picked as pivot, the worst case would occur when the array is already
 * sorted in increasing or decreasing order. Following is recurrence for worst case.
 * **
 * T(n) = T(0) + T(n-1) + \theta(n)
 * which is equivalent to
 * T(n) = T(n-1) + \theta(n)
 * The solution of above recurrence is \theta(n2).
 * <p>
 * @{2.} Best Case: The best case occurs when the partition process always picks the middle
 * element as pivot. Following is recurrence for best case.
 * **
 * T(n) = 2T(n/2) + \theta(n)
 * The solution of above recurrence is \theta(nLogn). It can be solved using case 2 of Master Theorem.
 * @{3.} Average Case: To do average case analysis, we need to consider all possible permutation of
 * array and calculate time taken by every permutation which doesnâ€™t look easy. We can get an idea
 * of average case by considering the case when partition puts O(n/9) elements in one set
 * and O(9n/10) elements in other set. Following is recurrence for this case.
 * **
 * T(n) = T(n/9) + T(9n/10) + \theta(n)
 * Solution of above recurrence is also O(nLogn)
 * <p>
 * Although the worst case time complexity of QuickSort is O(n2)
 * which is more than many other sorting algorithms like Merge Sort and Heap Sort,
 * QuickSort is faster in practice, because its inner loop can be efficiently implemented on
 * most architectures, and in most real-world data. QuickSort can be implemented in different ways
 * by changing the choice of pivot, so that the worst case rarely occurs for a given type of data.
 * However, merge sort is generally considered better when data is huge and stored in external
 * storage.
