 * <p>
 * A tree is a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges. It is widely
 * used in computer science to represent relationships, such as organizational structures, file
 * systems, or decision-making processes.
 * <p>
 * Key Characteristics of a Tree:
 * Root: The topmost node in the tree. There is only one root in a tree.
 * Node: Each element in the tree is called a node. A node can contain data and references to other nodes (children).
 * Edge: The connection between two nodes. If node A points to node B, then the edge connects A and B.
 * Parent-Child Relationship: A parent node is one that has edges to other nodes (children). A node with no children is called a leaf node.
 * Subtree: A tree consisting of a node and its descendants.
 * Depth: The level of a node in the tree (distance from the root).
 * Height: The maximum depth of the tree.
 * <p>
 * Example of a Tree:
 * Consider a simple tree that represents a family structure:
 * <p>
 * # Example Tree:
 * #        A (Root)
 * #       / \
 * #     B     C
 * #    / \     \
 * #   D   E     F
 * <p>
 * ooHere:
 * <p>
 * A is the root.
 * B and C are children of A.
 * D and E are children of B, and F is a child of C.
 * D, E, and F are leaf nodes (no children).
 * <p>
 * Types of Trees:
 * Binary Tree: A tree where each node has at most two children.
 * Binary Search Tree (BST): A binary tree where for every node, the left child is smaller, and the right child is larger than the nodeâ€™s value.
 * Balanced Tree: A tree where the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by at most one.
 * AVL Tree: A self-balancing binary search tree.
 * Heap: A binary tree where every parent node is either greater or smaller than its children (max-heap or min-heap).
 * <p>
 * Tree Traversal:
 * Traversal refers to the process of visiting all the nodes in a tree.
 * There are different methods of traversing a tree:
 * <p>
 * Preorder Traversal: Visit the root, traverse the left subtree, and then the right subtree.
 * Inorder Traversal: Traverse the left subtree, visit the root, and then the right subtree.
 * Postorder Traversal: Traverse the left subtree, traverse the right subtree, and then visit the root.
 * Level Order Traversal: Visit nodes level by level, starting from the root.
